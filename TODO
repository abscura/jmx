- expose the JMXEntity::privateData API in the javascript context
- allow to provide input values (of any supported type) through the GUI
  * size and point are missing and REALLY important *
- allow to change entity names from the GUI (it used to work ... but not anymore)
- osc entity (input and output)
- implement exporters (file save and streaming)
- import openCV to implement core entities for image-analysis
- allow to group 'diagrams' from the GUI and to access such groups as a sort of 'macro' in other diagrams
- write a kernel extension to export video mixers as video-input-devices
- write a kernel extension to export audio mixers as audio-input/output-devices
- improve (and finish implementing) JMXAudioMixer
