- switch to NSOperation for signal delivery
  (instead of handling a fixed number of workers by ourselves)
- implement an audio-spectrum-visualizer entity (mostly for debugging purposes)
- implement audio-prebuffering properly to avoid sporadic clicks when a sample buffer 
  is not produced in time (we don't need that much prebuffering, but a minimum is required
  to avoid clicks)
- allow to provide input values (of any supported type) through the GUI
- give as much space as possible on the board (reducing entity/font size ?)
- extend inspector functionalities
- allow applying videofilters 
- allow to move multiple slected items all together
- allow to group 'diagrams' and to access such groups as a sort of 'macro' in other diagrams
- introduce a scripting language (javasript? lua?)
- make a website
